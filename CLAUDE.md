what am i thinking? what am i feeling?



lau came and left today with the bed

ivan looked really sad

i saw a very sad look on ivans face

i also feel it was very sad that lau left

she came and she was very friendly and nice

she slept for a little with him



also i went yesterday to the family gathering

lots of people that seem really cool, but i felt distant to my aunts and uncles

i felt as though they were distant as well

that they thought i was akward

but it may be that i was a little paranoic when i got there



should i stop smoking weed a little bit?



would i take different decitions if i stop smoking weed?

i should try to

could it be that currently i am using weed as a coping mechanism instead of pod? jajajajajaj

i should pay very special attention to that probably, 

&nbsp;	maybe i smoke now when im stressed?

&nbsp;		why is stress such a bitch like that, well its not stress per say, it's i guess the natural behavior 

&nbsp;		of the brain to look for a coping mechanism to try to deal with stressful situations  it always looks for a coping mechanism



but yeah i was thinking also of my dad i guess, because of the family gathering 

hes not been appearing much, and when i call him he tells me its okay, that i dont need to visit
and that i think takes away the drive to go visit him

but hes taking loans

i dont know if hes depressed

tio teo Tambien i should visit more at some point

also cesar, y mucha otra gente

pero sabes que? eso es una mierda legalmente, porque guau yo me tengo que sentir mal porque otra gente me extrana?

even si son amigos mios, con mas razon, porque ellos habrian de poner esa carga sobre mi



tengo que aprender a estar enojado, probablemente, igual que ivan

porque enserio creo que yo tengo anger embotellada 

porque esa vez que re explote en Stanford, fue super out of left field



i need to analyze my brain more



but still, why do i feel this kinda sadness
